# jQuery
jQuery is a JavaScript Library.
The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

## How?
jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into **methods** that you can call with a single line of code.

## Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages
There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:

- Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
- Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google
### Google CDN:
```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

## Syntax
Basic syntax is: **$(selector).action()**

A **$** sign to define/access jQuery
A **(selector)** to "query (or find)" HTML elements
A jQuery **action()** to be performed on the element(s)
